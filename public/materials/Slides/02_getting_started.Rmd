# Definitions. What Is Network Analysis?

---

## What is a network (i.e., a graph)?

A set of **nodes** and **relation(s)** defined on them

```{r, out.width= "400px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/madmen.png")
```
---

## Defining Network Features & Measurements: What's a node?

- A <span style="color:DarkCyan">**node**</span> can be defined as an entity that can form relations with other entities.

**Synonyms**:

- actor: from sociometry, common terminology in sociology and psychology
- vertex: from graph theory (i.e., math), common terminology in mathematics and physics

Term node is common in statistics and applied sciences outside of soc and psych.
---

## Examples of Nodes

- Individuals (Mad Men characters, legislators)
- Families (Padgett and Ansell's reading)
- Human Rights NGOs
- Countries

---

## Defining Network Features & Measurements: What's a relation?

- A <span style="color:DarkCyan">**relation/tie**</span> defines the existence of an attribute relating nodes.

**Synonyms**:

- link: common in computer science (e.g., huge lit on “Link Prediction”) and social sciences
- edge: graph theoretic terminology common in physics and math, but also elsewhere

**Ties can have characteristics**:

- Weight
- Qualitative attributes
- Direction

## Let's brainstorm ties to go with our nodes

- Romantic relationship, marriage, friendship
- Business relationship
- Cooperation/conflict

## Origins and History of Network Analysis
Early Puzzles

- Sociologists began using the term as early as 1887 and early 1990s
- Emile Durkheim, Jacob Moreno, and later Harrison White (among others) were interested in understanding social patterns and the relations between members of a system.
	+ How do people feel towards one another? Why might this matter?

---
## Early study of network analysis

Early Puzzles: Individuals inside social groups

- Example: In 1932 there was a pandemic of runaways at Brooklyn public and private schools: within two weeks 14 girls ran away, which was 30 times more than the average number
 - Moreno's finding: position in network predicted whether the girl would run away

How can we capture these relationships? <span style="color:MediumAquamarine"> *The Sociomatrix*. </span>
example: <span style="color:Purple"> *PONIES* </span>

knitr::include_graphics("images/horserank1.jpg")
```

<span style="color:DarkCyan"> Directed, targeted behavior </span>

```{r, out.width= "600px",fig.align="center"}

```

## Sociomatrix: Pony grooming
<span style="color:DarkCyan"> Undirected, mutual behavior </span>

```{r, out.width= "500px",fig.align="center"}

```
---
## How might we look at this in R?

- Our class has an R package that will contain all the datasets.

- To load our class package (you have to do this each time you need to access the data):
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ochyzh/networkdata")
library(networkdata)
```

- Now, load the specific dataset:
```{r,  message=F, echo=TRUE}
data(highlandPonies)
ponies<-as.matrix(highlandPonies[1:17, 2:18])
```

Create a graph object:

```{r, echo=TRUE, results = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
pGraph <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(ponies, weighted=TRUE, mode="undirected",
                                      diag=FALSE)
```

---
## Plot using the *igraph* package:

```{r, echo=TRUE, results = FALSE,fig.show = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
V(pGraph)$color <- ifelse(V(pGraph)$name %in% c("WT", "WH", "WS"), "azure1", "turquoise")
ponyPlot<- plot(pGraph,
     edge.arrow.size=.2,
     edge.color="black",
     vertex.frame.color="black",
     vertex.label=V(pGraph)$names,
     vertex.label.color="black", layout=layout_with_fr,
     edge.width=E(pGraph)$weight/5, edge.curved=.08)
```

---

## Mutually supportive behavior between ponies

```{r, out.width= "500px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ponies.png")
```

---
## Other Examples of Neworks

- Survey data (Mexico violence)
- Text (co-occurrence matrices)
- Event data (conflict between actors, shared behavior between actors)
- Membership data (subcommittees)

# Collecting network data

---
## Activity 1: Build your own sociomatrix of shared experience
Break-out groups interview

1. Brainstorm a question you can ask each member of the group.
2. Keep the question simple yet specific enough to get variation in this small sample, i.e. "have you ever visited Texas" or "have you ever graphed a social network before?"
3. Record this observational data where in each observation (person) is a row in the data and their response (the variable you measured) is a column.
4. Now transform this data, with pen and pencil, into a sociomatrix.

## Activity 1: Undirected sociomatrix of Shared Interests

Step 2: A simple, undirected, sociomatrix

## Networks in Political Science
Today: Systems (Dyads --> Networks)

- Researchers recognize that dyads cannot be studied independently
- Network analysis is seen in a wide variety of applications both within and beyond Political Science:
	+ geography
	+ spatial analysis
	+ conflict studies
	+ peer-networks
	+ congressional voting

## Dealing with Data
You might begin with either a matrix or information stored separately about edges and nodes. This depends on your data collection strategy.

Useful terminology for working in *R*:

  + Matrices: the adjacency matrix
  + Edges: linkages between actors or nodes
  + Vertices: nodes (or actors) in your system

## How can we go beyond dyads?

How do we restructure a dyadic data frame such as alliances from COW into a matrix format?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data(defAlly)
head(defAlly)

```

---
## Your Turn (5 min)

Can you transform `defAlly` into a matrix form as shown below?


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
defMat<-readRDS("./data/defMat.rds")
defMat[1:20,1:20]
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cntries = unique(defAlly$ccode1)
defMat = defAlly |>
  dplyr::filter(year==2012) |>
  dplyr::select(ccode1, ccode2, defAlly) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from="ccode2", values_from="defAlly") |>
  dplyr::select(ccode1, "2", everything()) |>
  as.matrix()

rownames(defMat) = cntries
defMat = defMat[,-1]
defMat[is.na(defMat)] = 0
diag(defMat) = NA


#with a loop:
defMat1<- as.data.frame(matrix(0, length(cntries),length(cntries)))
names(defMat1)<- row.names(defMat1) <- cntries

for (i in 1:nrow(defAlly)){
  ccode1<- as.character(defAlly$ccode1[i])
  ccode2<- as.character(defAlly$ccode2[i])
  val<- defAlly$defAlly[i]
  defMat1[ccode1,ccode2]<-val
}

```

## What We've Learned So Far

- Network analysis has applications to many fields, from animal science to economics and political science.
- Network data are most often stored as a sociomatrix.
- Networks may contain important structures that are missed if treated as dyadic data.
- Network data are easily visualized using `igraph`.
- Convert long-form (dyadic) data into a matrix in $R$.
