## The Problem

- Causal inference is predicated on comparing the observed to the counterfactual.

    - Example: To show that the Medici rose to power due to their high network centrality, we must compare the Florentine network to a counter-factual, in which the Medici did not hold a central position.
    
- Often cannot change one aspect of the network while holding all else constant

    - Cannot change an actor centrality without changing centrality of other actors.
    - Example 1: Cannot observe what a policy diffusion process across US states would look like in the absence of New York and California.
    - Example 2: What would the post-World War II international alliance network would look like without the United States?

## Approach So Far

- Find the best possible specification that generates networks similar to the observed network.

- Make inferences regarding the likely processes that led to the formation of the observed network: e.g. preferential attachment, homophily.

---

## A Causal Approach

- Find a sample of social networks, such that some features (e.g.the central nodes' transmission potential) are disabled in some of the networks, but not the others.

- Examples: Covid-19 vaccine prioritization policies in the US, censorship on Twitter

- Rather than inferring association (and causation) from the model's functional form, set up a (pseudo-) experiment to test an observable implication of your theory.

## Research Design

- Most similar cases: California and Oregon counties

- Matching on demographic and economic variables

- Treatment: California opened vaccine eligibility to grocery workers (central nodes) about 1 month earlier than Oregon.
